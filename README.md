**Creating and maintaining Homebridge plugins consume a lot of time and effort, if you would like to share your appreciation, feel free to "Star" or donate.**
-->

This is a plugin for Philips Air+ Smart Tower Heaters.

## Installation

After [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) has been installed:

```
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge-philipsairplus-platform@latest
```

The plugin uses a library based on `python3`. To use the plugin, Python/Pip must be installed!

```
sudo apt install python3-pip git
```

You also need the `phipsair` module from [M. Frister](https://github.com/mfrister/phipsair):

```
sudo pip3 install -U phipsair
```

### Docker Installation

If you are running Homebridge in a Docker container (e.g., `homebridge/homebridge`), you need to install the dependencies using the startup script.

Create or edit the file `/homebridge/startup.sh` with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install phipsair library
apt update && apt install -y python3 python3-pip
pip3 install phipsair --break-system-packages
```

Make sure the script is executable and restart your container.

## Device ID Auto-Detection

The plugin can automatically detect the `deviceId` from the device's IP address. Simply leave the `deviceId` field empty and provide the `ip_address`.

If you prefer to manually get the deviceId, use the following phipsair command:
```
phipsair -H <ip-address> status -J
```

> **Note:** The plugin will check if `phipsair` is installed at startup. If not found, an error message will be displayed in the logs.

## Example Config

### Minimal configuration (with auto-detection)

```json
{
    "platforms": [
        {

## HomeKit Controls

When you add the device to HomeKit, you will see the following controls:

### Thermostat

The main thermostat control with the following modes:

| Cool         | Ventilation |

> **Note:** Medium and Low modes are not directly accessible via HomeKit but are preserved if set via the Philips app.

### Switches

HomeKit displays switches with generic names ("Switch", "Switch 2", etc.). Here is the mapping:

| HomeKit Name   | Function    | Description                              |
|----------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| Switch 1       | Oscillation | Enables/disables the swing rotation      |

| Backlight      | Backlight   | Controls the display backlight (CX5120 only) |

> **Tip:** You can rename these switches in the Home app by long-pressing the accessory and selecting "Accessory Settings".
